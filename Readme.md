# Hackathon Project

We created this project as a result of a blockchain based health hackathon conducted in PES University.

We have essentially built an e-commerce pharmacy website where patients can buy their prescription medication. 
It is through the blockchain that we are ensuring that the prescription belongs to the patient itself and that it has been given by 
the right doctor. For further technical details please read the documentation.docx file in this repo.

Tech stack used: NextJS, IPFS, Ethereum smart contracts, Solidity

Unfortunately due to the scale of this project and the fact that it was a 24 hour hackathon, we were unable to integrate the back-end and 
the front-end together. Which is why we have attached below, two video links demonstrating the IPFS portion as well as the Ethereum smart contract.
We were interacting with the smart contract functions using ethers.js, but the front-end was being built using NextJS and the ThirdWeb library to 
connect to an ethreum node. We were unable to integrate the backend with the frontend.
Once again, for further technical details please read the documentation.docx file in this repo.
